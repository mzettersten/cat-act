p954333,See below.,"I chose something similar to what I've already seen, but not the same, to see if it's a more general word or more specific word.",
p450452,Each word indicated a certain group. How specific the group depended on each word.,I chose the object that seemed the most similar.,
p533118,"No, they all seemed self-explanatory",The first one I saw that matched the other pics,
p74730,I just looked at the picture and looked for a common item. ,I chose the one that was the most similar. ,
p887090,I did my best of knowledge,dog,Nice
p190393,i just guess it,for the last object,no
p522248,No.,Color of the other pepper.,No.
p128423,no,no particular strategy,thanks
p828555,No strategy used,I chose based on how similar an object was in comparison to the 3 examples given,No further comments.
p549661,I would click on other images close to the one shown to see if it was the same but maybe should of click on something else to see if it was still the same,something that was close to what was shown,
p644590,Yes. I simply looked at the pictures and identified them based on their classification. ,I clicked on a random picture not related to the first three pictures.,I don't have any additional comments.
p158222,n/a,went with my gut,no comments
p76121,I looked at the photos and picked the ones that resembled the ones already shown.,I picked the one that was most similar.,
p453790,No.,I tried to find which image had the most in common with the first three examples.,No.
p934061,No specific strategy was used. ,I choose a similar object to the rest.,
p19458,There wasn't any strategy other than observation.,"If there was a slight difference between the examples and the unnamed photos, I chose that one to make sure my interpretation was correct.",no
p837076,No real strategy. I guess it was very clear and not hard to know what the words meant.,Initially I didn't get it because I felt understood the word but realized that there may be a word that is more generalizing and use that to choose the 4th objects to make sure I wasn't generalizing.,None
p730879,I tried to use the one additional example to rule out generalities (dog vs dalmatian),I tried to use the one additional example to rule out generalities (dog vs dalmatian),n/a
p838829,I took into consideration how specific the images given seemed to be,"If the first three examples were highly similar, I chose an object as close as possible to the examples. If they were less similar, I chose an object I thought should fit into the group to see if my theory was correct",none

p685889,Process of elimination.,What was left over from the previous slide.  ,no
p189508,I tried to find things similar to the original pictures.,I picked something that I thought the word was,
p811688,"The word were pretty obvious, didn't need a strategy.",By looking for the same object or class of objects.,
p47675,No,I wanted to test it against something that might teach me more.,no
p135044,no,i forget,good to learn nice
p94737,I chose a definition that fit all the objects.,I chose an object that was similar but not an exact match to see if the word was a general or specific term.,no
p793538,I just paid attention to the instructions.,I simply used the process of eliminatiom,No comment. Thank you!
p355363,no,whichever looked similar to the three pictures,no
p660952,similar attributes,similar appearance,none
p205933,N/A,N/A,N/A
p214563,Not really. It was pretty guess work,To see if the first word was just for one type. So if the word was just for dog or for all animals,
p685773,like items,like items,
p656068,It was pretty much just common sense,I just wanted to confirm by choosing a similar picture.,
p580839,I looked at the commonalities of the images.,I chose based on the commonalities of the first three images. Whatever image looked to be in common with those was the image that I chose.,None.

p353394,no,something similar,none
p791182,I just looked at the pictures and tried to see if they all had something in common.,A picture that looked the most similar to the other three.,No
p337698,No,seeing picture,
p878480,I just tried to follow the examples.,I wanted to confirm the pattern.,None thanks.
p26706,"yes, i tried to see if the word was generic or specific by clicking on similar items to narrow it down. ",i tried to choose something in the same similar generic category to see what the word might mean,none
p103585,I used a mix of learning similar and dissimilar objects.,I tried a mix of learning similar and dissimilar objects.,
p273362,I always asked about an item that could be on the fringe of a category,I wanted to know whether an object that was different could be the same,None
p345845,I just used my best intuition,I wanted to see if I was learning either a specific word or a general word (for example: was beppo the word for Dalmatian specifically or was the word beppo applicable to all dogs),
p665337,No,understnding,This study was useful.
p662655,I tried to figure out if it was specific vs. category,I looked for something in the same category but with a different proper name,"No, thanks."
p169594,none,that matches the first objects ,
p293042,nope,i chose an object that would further confirm what the word was. something similar to the three objects,
p747048,what the objects had in common,tried to pick a similar but not identical object to figure out how broad/narrow the word was,
p274431,I tried to pick something similar but slightly different than what I had already saw ,Pick something in the same category ,No
p125249,"I tried to find connections between the new word and the old word, ie sibu is bus i ",I chose an animal,
p627321,It was pretty easy! No strategy required.,I was choosing another that I thought fit the category to be extra sure I knew what the word represented.,Thank you! Have a great afternoon!
p57176,"No, just used by memory","at first i chose something different, but then I chose the like object to make sure I understood the meaning",Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this study
p397334,"I tried to put it into a general category, but the very first one may have confused me. I didn't allow my own theory to hold true.","What seemed to fit closest to the three examples, although as I was choosing the dog, I think there was a better fit that I missed.",

p714829,See below.,"I chose an object which was similar, but not identical, to the first three examples shown so I could determine if the word meant something more specific or general.",
p722675,I tried to pick someone close to the examples and see if that was a the same so I could make my best guess of what the word means.,I clicked things that were close to the examples and compared the words and images to figure it out. ,Fun Survey!
p720697,No.,Memory.,
p33050,no,I chose the radish,
p215985,no,I tried to see in the list if there were similar objects. ,no
p15345,I did best of my knowledge,I did best of my knowledge,nice
p112200,No,Based on the before example,It was a nice survey.
p664956,No,I did my best of knowledge.,Good
p363785,no special strategy,by deduction,"All clear, no problems"
p352951,Narrowing down and seeing which were grouped together with process of elimination if possible.,"Process of elimination and choosing a picture that looked similar to see if it was a different word or not. If not, the word applied to the fourth object.",Fun! Thank you!
p26598,"It seemed somewhat simple, I sometimes wanted to test whether certain veggies or animals or vehicles were all the same word.",I tried to pick one I wasn't sure what category it might be in.,thanks for a decent pay rate.
p287152,"No, I just thought about it.",I wanted to see if something similar but not exact was also that word.,"No, but thanks for the HIT!  I did my best and hope the data is useful!"
p210170,No real strategy.  It was pretty easy to figure out.,Something similar to the first three.,Everything was fine.
p661641,I looked to see what features the three figures had in common.,I wanted to test my theory so I picked the object I thought would either prove or disprove my theory.,This was a lot of fun and should have been longer. 
p794175,I tried to guess what the word was from the first 3 images and then test it with my choice of the fourth.,"I looked at all of the choices and tried to pick an option that didn't necessarily fit with my original guess (so should have a different name), but could also make another logical group (so would have the same name). If it had a different name than the first three I went with my original guess, if it ended up having the same name as the first three I went with my second guess.","No, thank you."
p893868,"I tried to find similar items to test if was included in the larger category.  If they were, then I assumed it was a more general broad category.",I tried to choose something different but still could be related.  Instead of just choosing the same image that was included in original set.  I was trying to rule out what might not be included in a larger grouping.,"Interesting study, enjoyed the challenge."
p614762,Just intuition and picked the object to learn the name of to eliminate possibilities.,I wanted to try and narrow down the category,
p864584,Click the closest item in the category,I clicked the closest item most similar to the previous examples,
p95044,"Not really.  I mean, sure, I wanted to find similarities.  A school bus isn't an animal, so the bus wasn't going to be a kita.",I was choosing something clearly different.  It just made it easy to eliminate stuff.,
p154662,I just used to examples and selected the objects closest to them in similarity.,I looked for similar objects that matched the examples.,None
p887558,Photos and what is similar.,What matched photo best.,No errors seen.
p788707,yes narrowing down by example how the dogs were all dalmations and the peppers were mostly pappers,"combining the name and images shown, i am not sure how to explain it besides saying in my head i just combined those 2. sorry, its not a generic answer or anything i just don't know a better way to say it",very very interesting thank u!
p106639,I compared the photos and categorized them instinctively,I chose one that I thought would be dissimilar but not too dissimilar,"I didn't notice any errors or typos and had no issues at all, thanks!"
p885537,"for the last one, I realized that the purpose of that option was to discern and see if there were any variations outside of the initial selection. So I used it for the last word to make sure it was only buses and not other vehicles","Seen above. I didn't realize until the last example what the option was for. When I did, I chose a related object that wasn't included in the initial selection. ",
p762684,NO,BY MEMORYING,GOOD
p899924,no,Followed any hunch I might have,
p722850,No,My own preference.,No
p194883,Picked similar objects.,I wanted to see if all the similar items had the same name.,
p496586,No,picture,
p313449,not really,chose a matching object,no
p536263,I don't know exactly.,I chose one that might or might not be in this word category. I didn't choose any that definitely were not in the word category. Sometimes there was only one that fit.,"Fun, like a game!"
p282189,Nothing specifically.,Things that shared similar traits.,
p114578,No strategy for me,I picked the one that seemed like the examples,None
p635820,Mostly trying to confirm if the word applies to to a singular category.,I tried to choose something that could be related in order to determine if there was a specific category.,I mispelled beppo.
p652374,not really,I chose whatever one I thought would be associated with that word to confirm.,none
p630967,Not really. ,I wanted something different to see if it could possible fit in the category as well.,thanks
p753363,Just go with instruction.,No,
p913294,I tried to find common features all of the example pictures contained.  I then picked the pictures that had those same features.,I picked the one most similar to the group.,
p216310,"No, I just used my instinct.","I chose an image similar, but different in some way, to make sure.",No.
p313421,I looked at the pictures and compared them to each other.,I compared the first 3 images with the 4th image.,"I enjoyed this study, thanks!"
p580147,I just tried to base it on similarities between objects.,I tried to choose an object that was different than the one I learned about,
p308156,no it was literally elementary school child level of intuition required,because it was really easy,
p507052,none,Related to the matching picture,good
p711050,I just followed the instructions and made an educated guess. It was a very straightforward experiment.,I wanted to see if the word was specific or general. ,no
p57895,no,same object fount in the fourth one,none
p183084,No,I checked the correlation of objects,
p666567,I could tell from the examples,same image,no
p659185,"I tried to pick something that was close to the pictures, but not quite, to see if the word extended to something less specific.",I wanted to see if it was a more general or specific word.,
p90117,it was easy to figure out what they really mean,I just thought it would be a similar object,none
p23479,nope,before see the object then choose next,nope
p593298,Identification technique,Same identification and representation,
p473892,I tried to push the limit by looking at a closely related word to see if it covered the meaning of the word. ,"I picked a closely related item, like a coach instead of a school bus to see if the word covered all busses",
p78310,NOPE,BEFORE SEE THE THREE OBJECTS TO CHOOSE NEXT OBJECT,INTERESTING
p134301,"When I was able to choose which object I would like to learn the meaning of, I started to select objects that we similar but could conceivably have a different word. I didn't do that the first time, though.","Oh, I just explained that. Similar object that could conceivably have a different word.",
p943948,I did not develop any kind of strategy ,I wanted to make sure the word meant something in general instead of a specific thing,
p96416,NO,NO,
p910597,no,based on the shape,
p905077,None,None,None
p193762,No,By seeing its similar objects,Interesting
p319241,"At first, I just tried to confirm the name of the group, but on the last trial I tried to choose something similar but not quite the same as the given grouping to expand the definition.",Same explanation as above.,None.
p199918,N/A,I choose randomly,N/A
p575642,Nothing,Good,Nice
p449048,N/A,I chose the object which most closely resembled the example images I was shown.,N/A
p897217,no,what made sense,
p194699,categorization,similar image,none
p60743,nothing,I just feel that,
p53756,no,chose the one of a kind,
p42893,Just look for similarities. ,Something to confirm my understanding of what the word would describe.,
p45411,Memory the images carefully.,New object,None
p959183,I used the pictures provided and then translated into English.,I randomly chose something different,Thank you
p145246,Nothing in particular.,Usually just selected something similar. ,
p742290,I didn't really have a strategy. I just used standard reasoning to determine what the word would mean based on looking at the photos with that word.,I just tried to decide which object was most similar to the three photos shown to me.,thank you!!
p541654,I did not use a strategy. I just tried to reason and come up with what logically the word meant,I tried to choose a word that would help me decide what the word means. So I wanted to pick something that looked different,no comments thank you
p563154,Find the word meaning,Guess,
p306510,Just observation,tried to find something that I thought didn't match,
p768639,To learn new language,Depends upon the picture,excellent study
p483454,Compare the objects and find what is the same between the images.,Choose something similar but not the same to see if the word has a broader meaning than I think.,
p651389,I tried to determine the common element among the images to determine the word meaning. ,"After the first trial, I realized that there might be some more differentiation between word meanings. So, I tried to choose images that would help me determine if a distinction existed. For example, I was initially uncertain whether sibu meant ""pepper"" or ""jalapeno pepper"" so I tried to choose a different kind of pepper to see if it was also a sibu. ",This was a fun study. Thanks for the opportunity to participate. 
p158492,I simply tried to match each word according to the theme that I noticed with each picture.,I chose an object that matched the previous three pictures that were shown.,none
p186860,OF THE CATEGORIES WERE DIFFERENT ,BELONGING THE SAME TYPE OF OBJECT OR ANIMAL,GOOD
p17229,"no, observation",I played it lazy and picked the similar one,I should have gone off script and selected other choices
p250801,By observing the collective objects that bear the name.,A different object from the three.,
p210585,No,I did best of my knowledge.,Good
p423258,"Yes, I looked for a common theme among the pictures.",I tested something close that might be a different word or might be the same word.,No
p630904,No,I chose it at first based on what I wanted to know and then based on what was closest to the objects already shown to me.,no
p648834,I picked what I thought could be the word to make sure if I was wrong or right.,I wanted to see if the similarities meant that they belong to the same word.,
p70394,no,I chose the same thing as shown in the examples.,no
p525628,No not really just common sense ,I choose the first imagine I saw that looked identical to previous objects,
p958965,None really. I just associated the word with the image to categorize it.,I would choose a word to see what is different usually.,
p612052,"no strategy, it was obvious to me",curiosity of something different,
p522461,"No, could just tell by the pictures.  It was pretty obvious.",I matched what I saw in the 3 examples.,
p745722,nothing,kita   beppo  ,well
p517874,I just paid attention to the pictures and tried to think logically,I picked something very different from the word I just learned.,
p924009,"I picked an object that resembled the ones presented but wasn't 100% a match. For instance, there were three Dalmatians and I picked another breed of dog. I did this because I wanted to know if the word meant dog in general, or just that breed of dog.","I picked an object in the same field as the objects presented, but slightly different. So, for example, I would pick a boat after being presented with three wheeled object. This narrows it down to being about transportation vehicles in general or just specific ones.",This was very well-designed.
p280054,No,I tried to select the related item,Thanks for the opportunity
p198283,I tried to figure out what they had in common. I then selected a picture that could fit the description to see if it had the same name,"I'd find something that COULD possibly be in the same category depending on the meaning of the word, so I'd see if it matched the word or not",no
p166326,"I just selected items from a group, suchs as vegetables or what not.","I clicked on an object I thought might be from the same group that I did not see an image for before, for conformation.",
p234288,no,an object that was the same as the examples,thank you
p910800,I just looked at what the 3 images had in common.,Clicked something that looked the same to verify.,I wish I clicked the yellow pepper!
p298867,"Not really, just trust my gut.",I try to choose a similar item to see if I can differentiate them.,
p94986,No,common sense,
p290599,No,See how it related to the other examples,
p122968,"No, I just used my memory",I don't understand this question. I just tried to follow the instructions on the screen.,no
p841045,"When I thought I had an idea of what it was, I tested it on the next page that showed different words that you can learn.",I chose an object that was similar.,No
p675043,No strategy,I picked the one that was most similar to try and figure out what the word meant.,
p127471,No strategy,I chose something that was related to the item but wasn't an exact match ,
p704834,Nothing,Peepo ,
p734685,NO,NO,
p474872,Just memorization,I just chose the object i was Interested in learning the new name of.,Thank You!
p454566,no,if it was from a similar group,
p842719,I did not use any strategy,Ides wise,n/a
p850108,memory recall,the one with the clearest resemblance with given examples,none
p708643,nothing, sibu  beppo kita,well
p735302,Animal and vegtable,beppo,None
p118377,Choose to see similar object/thing to confirm if word I thought of was correct,Based on type of examples shown like if it was an animal was common theme or all buses,none
p751807,not particularly,something new / different,
p980041,"I would click on an item that was somewhat related to make sure a broader category wasn;t included in with the word. From there, I would determine the meaning of the word.",I would choose an item closely related to the 3 images and make sure the word didn't encompass a larger category of items.,
p178785,Just my own knowledge,Different object,
p348653,No,"I always tried to select the object of the new word i am learning, to be sure if the object is really named the suggested word.",
p50778,I tried to make sense of the items that had the same name and find the main similarity between them.,I chose to see the most logical option to confirm my assumptions.,"Nothing additional, thanks!"
p43554,no,same object,Good
p863034,I didn't really have a strategy,I usually just picked a similar example to see if I was on the right track.,none
p362180,It was easy to see the comparisons. ,I chose what would fit into the group. ,Thanks 
p591868,"No strategy, just common sense.",I chose intuitively.,No additional comments.
p592210,"No, I just knew the words naturally.",I followed due instructions by learning the new words given and understanding its meaning. ,It was great.
p149741,Not necessarily,Just something I generally liked the look of,
p542097,None,another object,
p558362,I compared the images with the other images provided.,I chose the one that looked most like the examples.,Nice study.
p601641,Not really...I just picked the broadest group that all three pictures might belong in,"I picked something similar but nit exact - as in a different breed of dog, a different vehicle, another vegetable. ",
p765490,I thought about what all the things had in common when first learning the word and then choosing an image that looked like the originals or one similar.,"I usually chose an object that was similar but had one difference to see if there was a different word for it, like all the green peppers were given and I chose the yellow one to see if yellow peppers were included for the word or if color didn't matter.",No.
p246589,no,bus,good study
p501797,Just basic memorization and deduction,I followed the pattern,"The question below the ""pick the object"" was confusing...it asked me which of these would I like to learn the name of, not pick the correct one. "
p851779,"yes, I examined the pictures and identified features such as vehicle, animal, color, etc.",select an object with one similarity to the original to isolate the meaning of the new word,no
p42119,"In the first two I went by the given examples. But in the third, I picked a ""close but not quite"" example to narrow it down. I SHOULD have done that for all three.","Something close, but not exact.",
p128618,I just looked for the items that were the most similar\,it was fairly intutive I think so I went with the similarities and then choose,
p220604,I did not.,One that was opposite of the others,
p187026,no,I tried to pick an object a little different from the examples to test other possible meanins.,
p92051,ITIS VERY GOOD TO PARTICIPATE,IT IS VERY GOOD,
p585977,I did not follow any stretagy,"I chose the fourth object based on my understanding of the word, the context of the examples, and my knowledge of the objects. For instance, if the word was ""fluffy"" and the first three examples were a pillow, a cloud, and a teddy bear, I might choose a cat as the fourth object to see a word for next.",n/a
p942454,picture relations,choose the same ,
p450544,no,based on the previous 3 objects,
p782233,arranging words ,bus dog,no
p415104,no,from the example given,none
p501272,not exactly. i just remembered it,one which was close to the one showed,
p325855,no,i chose object that was similar,no
p349553,The examples really helped and I just tried to confirm what I thought,To click something similar but not exactly the same to find the word definition.,That was fun!  Thank you for letting me participate.
p545033,Just tried to see how broad the category the word presented was and if I could rule in or out anything further than what I was specifically shown.,Picked something that could be in a broader category of that object (e.g. picking a different animal when I was shown 3 dogs to see if the word meant dog or animal).,no
p213137,I looked for similarities.,I wanted something that was slightly different from the other 3.,
p945474,No strategy.,I wanted to choose an object that was totally different.,
p564386,Just trying to associate the alike objects with the word.,based on what was most similar to the other three,
p204347,Decided what all of the objects had in common and went from there on figuring out what the word may be.,I determined what objects may be related to the examples.,N/A.
p304827,I just tried to figure out if they were grouped into a category,if it was similar but different looking,
p329853,"No, I didn't.",Looking for similarities in the objects,
p278388,No,I discarded obvious examples and went for the next,No
p442267,think of the category and it was easy,if it was in a similair category ,
p642254,No,I looked for it to match the three previous examples,
p83397,no,i went with my gut.,no
p766944,NO,VERY EXSY MAKE DECISION,VERY EXCELLENT.
p84082,"I tried to figure out if the examples were misleadingly specific (e.g. dogs vs. mammals, chilis vs. vegetables) so for the freebie, I tried to pick something that would either prove or disprove my initial guess.",Same as above - tried to reduce ambiguity by picking a slightly different object than was in the examples.,
p606339,chose the same ones,Those that looked alike,
