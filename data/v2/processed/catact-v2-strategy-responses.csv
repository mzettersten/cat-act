p605577,Just making image associations.,I chose similar images to determine whether the definition was a lot more broad.,No issues. Great survey!
p748957,"At first with the beepo, I picked the image to confirm what I thought it was, whhich was bus, but I later on realised this was just to fulfill what I thought it was bias, so thats why next time I chose what also could be the animal instead of the dog to rule it out to being not just dogs but the vague topic.","As stated above, at first I chose what would fit into what I thought it was, but later realised this was the wrong path and instead chose the image that could still be it potentially and expand the meaning",

p55665,Not really. Just categorization. ,"Well sometimes two pictures would appear to be the correct choice and I could only choose one.

p83469,no,Something similar to the word,
p96874,"I usually selected images that most resembled the examples I was shown earlier.

p906882,No I just used common sense.,I wanted to make sure similar things were not the same name.,
p9547,"Not really. I looked for commonality among the examples given for the word. Then, if there was any uncertainty about whether additional, similar objects might also be represented by that word, I chose another object that was perhaps slightly different than the examples but within the same proposed ""class.""","If I was already pretty confident of the meaning of the word, I chose an object I was sure was likely in that class of objects to confirm. Otherwise, I chose an object on the ""edge"" of the class to see whether there was any difference. For example, one word had three school buses as examples. I wasn't sure if the word was only for school buses or any bus in general. When given the choice of other objects, I therefore picked a non-school bus to resolve this quandary.",
p563199,I simply looked at the pictures and found the common thing that have with one another.,I chose based on what may be different than the examples presented.,"Great Study, hope to do more in the future."
p56107,No,The one that looked the closest to the objest or was some how similar to it. Such as there were 3 animals that could be pets so the fourth object must be a pet too ,
p802929,Mostly just trying to memorize the word and then picking the same type,I tried to pick something different from the ones described by the word I already learned,
p609362,I looked for the commonality of the training objects to remember the word association and meaning.,It was non-animal and non-vegetable so I chose it.,I enjoyed this experience!
p934992,"There wasn't  much of a strategy, usually the word's meaning was pretty easy to narrow down from the first example objects.",I tried to choose something that would narrow down whether the word had a more broad or limited definition.,
p632294,I just used my judgement based on if each picture was in a category (like with the vehicles) or something very specific (like the Dalmatians).,I chose one that I felt fit into the category or subject.,
p443633,Well yes I picked something that seemed similar but different enough to know how specific the word was.,Again I chose something similar to the examples but not the same.,It was kind of fun.
p572701,n/a,i generally chose something different out of curiousity,
p221482,Not really.,"With the word ""kita"", I chose a non-Dalmatian dog to see if the word meant ""dog"" or ""Dalmatian"".",

For instance, I didn't select the green pepper but did choose the yellow pepper. ",I chose the object that resembled the other three without being exact. I didn't choose the bus or the pepper or any of the dogs.
